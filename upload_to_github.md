# 📤 Manual GitHub Upload Instructions

Since we're having authentication issues, here's how to manually upload the files:

## 🔧 **Option 1: Fix Token Permissions**

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Find your token or create a new one
3. Make sure these permissions are checked:
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ **admin:repo_hook** (if needed)
   - ✅ **delete_repo** (if you want full control)

4. Try this command with a fresh token:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_NEW_TOKEN@github.com/chickenpie-three/STAFFVIRTUAL-Discord-bot.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔧 **Option 2: GitHub Web Interface Upload**

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/chickenpie-three/STAFFVIRTUAL-Discord-bot
2. Click "uploading an existing file" link
3. Drag and drop all these files:
   - `main.py`
   - `knowledge_manager.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `README.md`
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `setup.py`
   - `.gitignore`
   - All other files in the directory

## 🔧 **Option 3: GitHub Desktop**

1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Clone the repository
3. Copy all files into the cloned folder
4. Commit and push through the GUI

## 📁 **Files to Upload:**

Here are all the files that need to be uploaded:
- `main.py` (979 lines) - Main Discord bot
- `knowledge_manager.py` - Knowledge base management
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies  
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `setup.py` - Setup script
- `Dockerfile` - Docker configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `env_template.txt` - Environment template
- `knowledge_base.json` - Default knowledge base
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment config
- `render.yaml` - Render deployment config
- `cloudbuild.yaml` - Google Cloud config
- `deploy.md` - Deployment guide
- `supabase_deploy.md` - Supabase guide
- `supabase/` folder with all Supabase configurations

## 🚀 **Once Uploaded:**

After the code is on GitHub, we can immediately:
1. Deploy to Railway (connects to GitHub automatically)
2. Set up Supabase database
3. Configure the hybrid deployment
4. Test all 12 AI agents

The bot is completely ready to deploy once the files are uploaded!
